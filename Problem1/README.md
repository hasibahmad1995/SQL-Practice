# Problem 1: Sales Analysis

You are given a table called Sales that contains data about sales transactions. The structure of the table is as follows:

- `TransactionID` (INT) - Unique identifier for each transaction
- `CustomerID` (INT) - Unique identifier for each customer
- `ProductID` (INT) - Unique identifier for each product
- `Quantity` (INT) - Number of units sold
- `Price` (DECIMAL) - Price per unit
- `TransactionDate` (DATE) - Date of the transaction

You need to write a query to find the total sales amount for each product in the month of June 2023.

### Problem Statement
Write a SQL query to find the total sales amount for each product in the month of June 2023.

## Problem 2: Customer Purchase Frequency

You have another table called Customers that contains data about customers. The structure of the table is as follows:

- `CustomerID` (INT) - Unique identifier for each customer
- `CustomerName` (VARCHAR) - Name of the customer
- `JoinDate` (DATE) - Date when the customer joined

The Sales table from the previous problem remains the same.

### Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to find the number of purchases made by each customer in the year 2023.

## Problem 3: Monthly Sales Trend

Now, you need to analyze the monthly sales trend for the year 2023. The structure of the Sales table remains the same.

### Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to find the total sales amount for each month in the year 2023. The result should include the month and the total sales amount.

## Problem 4: Top Customers by Sales

You need to identify the top 5 customers based on the total sales amount they have generated in the year 2023. The structure of the Sales and Customers tables remains the same.

### Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers by total sales amount in the year 2023.
